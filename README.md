# PuzzleTF - Phonological Disorder Game

The game will be created using the Unity Engine for desktop and will feature activities using minimum pairs which are: assembling puzzles and interpreting word phonemes that will be expressed by audio from a list of selected minimum pairs.

### Figures

Most of the figures were removed from the site: https://www.flaticon.com/ (Remembering that they are free for personal use)
The images were assembled and changed in the program: Adobe XD

### Audio

The audios used for image identification and choice were made by Kelly Ortiz and the tone of the sound was modified by the application: Lexis Audio Editor.

The audios of entry, correctness, error and end of game were made by Davi Garcia. Instagram: @davi.rpro
